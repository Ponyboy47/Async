// MARK: - Async â€“ Struct

/**
The **Async** struct is the main part of the AsyncBlockframework. Handles an internally `@convention(block) () -> Swift.Void`.

Chainable dispatch blocks with GCD:

    AsyncBlockbackground {
    // Run on background queue
    }.main {
    // Run on main queue, after the previous block
    }

All moderns queue classes:

    AsyncBlockmain {}
    AsyncBlockuserInteractive {}
    AsyncBlockuserInitiated {}
    AsyncBlockutility {}
    AsyncBlockbackground {}

Custom queues:

    let customQueue = dispatch_queue_create("Label", DISPATCH_QUEUE_CONCURRENT)
    AsyncBlockcustomQueue(customQueue) {}

Dispatch block after delay:

    let seconds = 0.5
    AsyncBlockmain(after: seconds) {}

Cancel blocks not yet dispatched

    let block1 = AsyncBlockbackground {
        // Some work
    }
    let block2 = block1.background {
        // Some other work
    }
    AsyncBlockmain {
        // Cancel async to allow block1 to begin
        block1.cancel() // First block is NOT cancelled
        block2.cancel() // Second block IS cancelled
    }

Wait for block to finish:

    let block = AsyncBlockbackground {
        // Do stuff
    }
    // Do other stuff
    // Wait for "Do stuff" to finish
    block.wait()
