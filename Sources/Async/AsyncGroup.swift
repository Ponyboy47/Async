// MARK: - AsyncGroup â€“ Struct

/**
The **AsyncGroup** struct facilitates working with groups of asynchronous blocks. Handles a internally `dispatch_group_t`.

Multiple dispatch blocks with GCD:

    let group = AsyncGroup()
    group.background {
        // Run on background queue
    }
    group.utility {
        // Run on untility queue, after the previous block
    }
    group.wait()

All moderns queue classes:

    group.main {}
    group.userInteractive {}
    group.userInitiated {}
    group.utility {}
    group.background {}

Custom queues:

    let customQueue = dispatch_queue_create("Label", DISPATCH_QUEUE_CONCURRENT)
    group.customQueue(customQueue) {}

Wait for group to finish:

    let group = AsyncGroup()
    group.background {
        // Do stuff
    }
    group.background {
        // Do other stuff in parallel
    }
    // Wait for both to finish
    group.wait()
    // Do rest of stuff
