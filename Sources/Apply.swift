`Apply` is an empty struct with convenience static functions to parallelize a for-loop, as provided by `dispatch_apply`.

    Apply.background(100) { i in

    }

`Apply` runs a block multiple times, before returning. If you want run the block asynchronously from the current thread, wrap it in an `Async` block:

    Async.background {
        Apply.background(100) { i in
            // Calls blocks in parallel asynchronously
        }
    }
